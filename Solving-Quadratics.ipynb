    "\n",
    "Goal: Learn how to find the solutions (roots) of a quadratic equation by graphing its corresponding function and identifying where it crosses the x-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 What Does It Mean to “Solve” a Quadratic by Graphing?\n",
    "\n",
    "A quadratic equation can be written in standard form as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ax^2 + bx + c = 0,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants (and $a \\neq 0$). The solutions to a quadratic equation are the values of $x$ that make the equation true (these are also called the roots or zeros of the quadratic).\n",
    "\n",
    "When we graph a quadratic function $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, we get a curve called a parabola (a U-shaped curve). To solve $ax^2+bx+c=0$ by graphing, we graph $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ and look for the points where the graph crosses the x-axis. At those points on the x-axis, $y = 0$, so the equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ is satisfied ￼. In other words, the x-coordinates of the x-intercepts of the parabola are the solutions to the quadratic equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the parabola crosses the x-axis in two places, there are two solutions (two distinct real roots).\n",
    "- If it just touches the x-axis (tangent) at one point, there is one solution (a double root).\n",
    "- If it doesn’t cross the x-axis at all, there are no real solutions (the quadratic has no real roots).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example (Graphical Solution):** Solve the quadratic equation $x^2 - 4 = 0$ by graphing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1. Write in $y=$ form: First, express the equation as a function: $y = x^2 - 4$.\n",
    "- 2. Graph $y = x^2 - 4$: Plot this parabola on a coordinate plane. You can make a small table of values: for example, $x = -3$ gives $y = 5$; $x = -2$ gives $y = 0$; $x=-1$ gives $y = -3$; $x=0$ gives $y=-4$; $x=1$ gives $y=-3$; $x=2$ gives $y=0$; $x=3$ gives $y=5$. Plot these points and sketch the smooth U-shaped curve through them. Graph of $y = x^2 - 4$. The parabola crosses the x-axis at $(-2, 0)$ and $(2, 0)$. These x-values are the solutions to $x^2 - 4 = 0$.\n",
    "- 3. Find x-intercepts: Looking at the graph, the curve crosses the x-axis at $x = -2$ and $x = 2$. These are the points where $y=0$.\n",
    "- 4. State the solutions: The solutions to $x^2 - 4 = 0$ are $x = -2$ and $x = 2$. (We can check by plugging these into the equation: $(-2)^2 - 4 = 4 - 4 = 0$, and $(2)^2 - 4 = 4 - 4 = 0$ ✅).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Checkpoint 1:** Without plotting an entire graph, can you tell how many solutions the equation $x^2 + 3 = 0$ might have? Hint: Think about the graph $y = x^2 + 3$ and where it sits relative to the x-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** $x^2 + 3 = 0$ has no real solution. The parabola $y = x^2 + 3$ is the curve $y=x^2$ shifted up by 3 units, so its vertex is at $(0,3)$ and it never touches the x-axis (it’s always above $y=0$). Therefore, it has no x-intercepts, meaning no real roots.\n"

    "Let’s try another example, this time a slightly more involved quadratic:\n",

    "Example: Solve $y = x^2 - x - 2$ by finding the roots (solve $x^2 - x - 2 = 0$).\n",

    "- If $x = 1$: $y = 1 - 1 - 2 = -2$. So $(1, -2)$.\n",
    "- If $x = 2$: $y = 4 - 2 - 2 = 0$. So $(2, 0)$.\n",
    "- If $x = 3$: $y = 9 - 3 - 2 = 4$. So $(3, 4)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plot these points and sketch the parabola through them. We see the parabola crosses the x-axis at (-1, 0) and (2, 0). Thus, the solutions to $x^2 - x - 2 = 0$ are $\\boxed{x = -1 \\text{ or } x = 2}$.\n",

    "(Notice: You might recognize this quadratic factors as $(x+1)(x-2)=0$, giving roots $x=-1$ and $x=2$. Graphing and factoring both find the same solutions.)\n",

    "\n",
    "Answer: It crosses the x-axis at $x = -1$ and $x = 1$. The solutions to $x^2 - 1 = 0$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 1$ (because $(-1)^2 - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0$ and $(1)^2 - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0$).\n"

    "### 1.3 Real-World Application – Using Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs of quadratics appear in many real-world situations, especially in physics and engineering. For example, the trajectory of a thrown ball is a parabola. We can use a graph to estimate when and where the ball will land.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Example (Projectile Height):** A ball is thrown upward from the ground. Its height (in feet) after $t$ seconds is given by the quadratic function $h(t) = -16t^2 + 16t$. (This comes from physics – the $-16t^2$ is due to gravity in ft/s², and $+16t$ means an initial upward speed of 16 ft/s.) When will the ball hit the ground?\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the problem: “Hit the ground” means the height is 0. We need to solve $-16t^2 + 16t = 0$ for $t$, using a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution (Graphical):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Graph the function: $y = -16t^2 + 16t$. This is an upside-down parabola (opens downward because of -16t²). At $t=0$, $y=0$ (starting at ground). At $t=1$ second, $y = -16(1)^2 + 16(1) = 0$ as well. At $t=0.5$ seconds, $y = -16(0.25) + 8 = -4 + 8 = 4$ feet. So the ball goes up to 4 feet at 0.5 s, then comes down.\n",
    "- Find x-intercepts: The graph starts at $(0,0)$, goes up a bit, then comes back to $(1,0)$. It crosses the t-axis (height 0) at $t=0$ (launch point) and $t=1$ (when it hits the ground).\n",
    "- Answer: The ball will hit the ground after 1 second (not counting the start at 0 seconds).\n",
    "\n",

    "2. $x^2 + 2x - 3 = 0$. Graph $y = x^2 + 2x - 3$. It factors as $(x+3)(x-1)=0$, so roots at $x = -3$ and $x = 1$. The parabola crosses at $(-3,0)$ and $(1,0)$. Solution: $x = -3$ or $x = 1$.\n",
    "3. $x^2 - 2x - 5 = 0$. Graph $y = x^2 - 2x - 5$. This one doesn’t factor nicely. By graphing (or using the quadratic formula later), we find it crosses the x-axis at approximately $x \\approx -1.45$ and $x \\approx 3.45$ (roughly). Solution: $x \\approx -1.45$ or $x \\approx 3.45$ (rounded).\n",
    "4. For $h(t) = -4.9t^2 + 19.6t + 24$, set $h(t)=0$ to find when the rocket hits ground. Graphing this downward parabola, we find it crosses the $t$-axis at two points: one near $t= -1$ (which we ignore, since negative time doesn’t physically make sense) and one at a positive $t$. Zooming in, the positive intersection is around $t \\approx 5.0$ seconds. Solution: About 5.0 seconds for the rocket to hit the ground. (In fact, using the quadratic formula later gives $t \\approx 5.0$ s as the positive root.)\n"

For example, if $x^2 = 25$, then $x = \\sqrt{25} = 5$ or $x = -\\sqrt{25} = -5$. We often write this as $x = \\pm 5$. Remember, there are two solutions whenever you take a square root in an equation (one positive, one negative), unless the context or equation restricts that (like a physical length can’t be negative).\n",
